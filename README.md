# Final-Year-Project

Our team's ongoing final year project, which attempts to analyze the quality of Korattur lake water based on various chemical parameters using Ensemble models (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) and Statistical models, and tries to combine both, proposing a Hybrid Model, and tests, if this holistic approach provides better results in designating the water to various classes (non-drinkable,good,drinkable) based on quality.
