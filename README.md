# Final-Year-Project

My team's ongoing final year project, which attempts to analyze the quality of Korattur lake water based on various chemical parameters using ML models (Decision tree, Random forest) and Statistical models, and tries to combine both, proposing a Hybrid Model, and tests, if this holistic approach provides better results in designating the water based to various classes (Low,medium,High,Excellent) based on quality.
